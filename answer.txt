The trend shown in the screenshot taken of the excel graph called size_vs_seconds_graph makes sense. 
As the file sizes get bigger, it takes a longer time to transfer all of the data.
The main bottleneck stopping the files from transferring faster is the buffer size.
We have it set to 256 and so the file can only transfer 256 bytes at a time which 
means more transfers every time we multiply the size and that of course takes more time.
To combat this, all we need to do is increase the buffer size so that more is 
getting transferred decreasing the time it takes to transfer files.
